description: This rule dictates how Python imports should be organized and sorted by string length to maintain consistency and readability across the codebase.
globs: **/*.py

- Group imports in the following order, with one blank line between groups:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party library imports
  3. Local application imports
- Within each group, sort imports by string length (shortest to longest)
- Use absolute imports instead of relative imports
- Import specific items from modules when possible
- Avoid using wildcard imports
- Keep imports at the top of the file, after any module-level docstring
- Format imports as follows:
  ```python
  # Standard library imports
  import os
  import sys
  import multiprocessing
  from pathlib import Path
  from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

  # Third-party imports
  import torch
  import numpy
  from tqdm import tqdm
  from sklearn import metrics

  # Local imports
  import my_utils
  from my_tools import ABC
  ```
