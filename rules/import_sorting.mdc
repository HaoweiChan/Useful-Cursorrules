description: This rule dictates how Python imports should be organized and sorted by string length to maintain consistency and readability across the codebase.
globs: **/*.py

- Group imports in the following order, with one blank line between groups:
  1. Standard library imports
  2. Third-party library imports
  3. Local application imports

- Within each group, sort imports by string length (shortest to longest)

- Format imports as follows:
  ```python
  # Standard library imports
  import os
  import sys
  import json
  import yaml
  import signal
  import random
  import pickle
  import logging
  import multiprocessing
  from pathlib import Path
  from types import SimpleNamespace
  from typing import List, Dict, Tuple
  from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor

  # Third-party imports
  import torch
  import numpy
  from tqdm import tqdm
  from sklearn import metrics

  # Local imports
  import utils
  import bound_param
  from bound_param import SampleResult, ParameterSet
  from sparam_to_ew import snp_eyewidth_simulation
  ```

- Use absolute imports instead of relative imports
- Import specific items from modules when possible
- Avoid using wildcard imports
- Keep imports at the top of the file, after any module-level docstring
